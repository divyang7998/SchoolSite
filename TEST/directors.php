		The Sheth Virchand Dhanji School is started with the aim to deliver education based on morals and ethics, with the vision to keep in sync with the technological innovations that happened in late 20th and 21st century. Many things have changed as the school has evolved and thanks to the commitment of the parents, staff and students. This evolution has been for the better, to the point where I believe this school now excels at providing rich and high quality educational system.
	</p></br>
	<p>
		Education without basic morals is like a high rise building without strong foundations or bridge without strong pillars. Therefore our mission at Sheth Virchand Dhanji School has been not only to provide children with world class education but also to make sure that they are made aware and conscious about the moral values and virtues. These values have sustained over the centuries and will endure for all times to come. Moral values, embedded deep into the hearts of young students give them the capabilities and the courage to face every adverse situation in life and emerge victorious in different struggles of life.
		<p></br>
		While moral values provide the foundations for success and happiness, modern day technology gives the leading edge for shining success. From day one since its inception, Sheth Virchand Dhanji School has indentified the need to include latest technological tools and methods in its teaching systems.

		Our students participate in many school and community events to provide opportunity to grow and achieve to their potential. We have high expectations from our students and of ourselves and work together to achieve them. We believe the lessons the students learn at Sheth Virchand Dhanji School will not only give them the best chance of success in future lives but will also help them be a part of creating a better world.
		I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all members of the Sheth Virchand Dhanji School community for their generous commitment during all these years : Principal, Teachers and school staff, my colleagues at the Management Committee and the students and their families.
